    "The calculation of the sentence polarity includes a couple of steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, it checks if the sentence contains a contrastive conjugation (e.g. \"but\"), then overweighs things after the but and underweighs previous elements. This seems quite natural for e.g. the sentence \"The movie was great, but the acting was horrible\", where the second statement is noticeably more important. This has also been shown empirically by [(Hutto and Gilbert, 2014)](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/14550). \n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, the model takes into account question marks and exclamations marks, which both increase the polarity of the sentence – negative sentences become more negative and positive sentences become less negative. Lastly, the polarity is normalized between approximately -1 and 1.\n",
