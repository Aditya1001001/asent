Inspired by Vader, made using SpaCy, transparent from the start.


## Simple Example
The following shows a simple example of how you can quickly apply sentiment analysis using asent. For more on using asent see the [usage guides].

```python
import spacy
import asent

# load spacy pipeline
nlp = spacy.load("da_core_news_lg")

# add the rule-based sentiment model
nlp.add_pipe("asent_da_v1")

# try an example
text = "jeg er ikke lÃ¦ngere sur. ðŸ‘¿"
doc = nlp(text)

# visualize the results
asent.visualize(doc)
```

# Tutorial

simple usage on texts

```
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_lg")
nlp.add_pipe("asent_en_v1") 

text = "I am angry ðŸ˜„"
doc = nlp(text)
doc._.polarity
```

visualize results
```
asent.visaulize(doc)
```

or if you have a long text it might be ideal to split it up into sentences.

```
text = "The plot was good, but the characters are uncompelling. The dialog on the other hand is great."

doc = nlp(text)
sentences = [sentence for sentence in doc.sents]

asent.visualize(sentences[0]) # visualize only the first sentence
```

# How does the model work?

Valence:
 1) Look up the word in the lexicon
 2) is the word all caps while the rest of the text is not, add capitilazation factor (0.733) to the valence score

Token polarity
 1) Start of with the token valence
 2) is the word intensified? If one of the three preceeding word is an intensifier add the intensifier score times a discounting constant such that intensifier 3 tokens away are not as influential as an intensifier one token away.
 3) is the word negated? If either of the three previous word is a negation multiply it by a negation factoer (-0.74)

Span or sentence polarity
1) Sum and normalize the score to be typically between -1 and 1.
2) If there is a contrastive conjugation (e.g. but) downweight the polarity score before and upweight the following score. E.g. "the cast was horrible, but the storyline was great", here horrible would be downweighted and great wieghted more.
3) If the sentence use exclamation or question mark amplifiy the polarity scores. Dependent on how many exclamationsmarks is present.
